    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>
        These savory jalapeño poppers are a great plant-based party or game day appetizer. Diced mushrooms add a "meaty" addition with the absence of bacon, and vegan cheese substitutes keep this appetizer vegan.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 medium jalapeno peppers, sliced in half and seeded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, finely diced</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) tub vegan cream cheese substitute, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan shredded cheese substitute, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set jalapeño halves on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, open side up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to the skillet and saute until vegetables are tender and mushrooms have released their liquid, about 8 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix mushroom mixture, cream cheese substitute, 3/4 cup shredded cheese substitute, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon into the jalapeño pepper halves on the baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and top with the remaining 1/4 shredded cheese substitute. Broil until the cheese is melted and slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
     </ol>
