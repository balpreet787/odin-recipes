    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic, sliced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Asian chile pepper sauce (such as sambal oelek), or more to taste            
        </li>
        <li>1 Â½ tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 8 wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mash garlic to a paste with a mortar and pestle. Mix chile pepper sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce, mayonnaise, and rice vinegar into garlic until marinade is thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken thighs to a large flat container (such as a baking dish) and pour marinade over chicken; stir until chicken is coated. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate about 3 hours; if preferred, let stand about 30 minutes at room temperature. Unwrap dish and sprinkle with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat charcoal grill to high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken thighs onto the hot grill with smooth sides down. Cook until chicken shows grill marks, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook until other side shows grill marks, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, moving them occasionally and turning over every 2 minutes, until meat is no longer pink inside and the thighs are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a platter, let rest for 5 minutes, and serve garnished with lime wedges.
        </li>
     </ol>
